# ORACLE Cloud Test Drive 3.0

## Introduction

Cloud Test Drive 3.0 contains the lab materials for the Oracle Cloud Test Drive events aims to showcase the power of Oracle Cloud solution for the enterprise to accelerate the digital transformation initiatives. Participants can gain the experience through the labs with a series of Oracle Cloud Services like ODA + OMC (Oracle Digital Assistant & Oracle Mobile Cloud) , CECS (Content and Experience Cloud Service) and PCS (Process Cloud Services). The objective is to provide the participants to get hands-on experience with these cloud services with the scenarios to build Application and Service with the Oracle Cloud Platform.

#### Oracle Digital Assistant & Oracle Mobile Cloud
Extending the scenarios in previous Cloud Test Drive, this session allows the user to extend the touch points to Digital Aisstants and Microsites. Digital Assistants have become one of the most popular channels with end-users where Natural Language Processing is used to capture the customer needs via a conversational approach. 
The combination of Oracle Mobile Cloud & The Oracle Digital Assistant is the platform to allow an enterprise to build and deploy mobile apps and intelligent digital assistants (or chatbots) that connect to any backend system. This lab guide the participant to design, configure and test the Digital Assistant to determine the end-user's needs via a humanistic conversation. In addition, the Digital Assistant allows for the input of more structured, form based data through the use of a powerful interactive feature called an Instant App.

#### Oracle Content and Experience Cloud Service
Microsite is another common touchpoint Enterprise build for promoting new service, campaign or for a specific purpose to complement with the major website. Oracle Content and Experience Cloud Service (CECS) empowers Enterprise not only to able build the Microsite without coding and comes with Content Hub to consolidate and manage digital assets like documents, images, sounds, video and etc to drive omni-channel content management and accelerate experience delivery. In the lab, the participant would have the chance to build a microsite and get experience of how to manage the digital management easily with CECS.  

#### Oracle Process Cloud Service
Process improves customer experiences and key drivers for digital transformation. Oracle Process Cloud can convert idea to process control within minutes based on the design builder, form builder and process automation capability.  In this lab, the participant has the chance to build a quick process to manage the document approval as the first trial of building process and automation. 

#### Oracle Visual Builder Cloud Service
Oracle Visual Builder Cloud Service is a cloud-based software development Platform as a Service (PaaS) and a hosted environment for your application development infrastructure. It provides an open-source standards-based solution to develop, collaborate on, and deploy applications within Oracle Cloud.
